Perfect Pancakes is an App that gives you the perfect recipe for your pancakes.
For the perfect pancakes you need 3 Parameters:

* **T** = the desired thickness of your pancakes in cm
* **A** = the amount of pancakes you want to eat
* batter needed in millilitres is:

### An Example

As an example we want to make **5** pancakes (A=5). You want to make them in your pan that has a diameter of **18 cm** (D=18). And you want a thickness of **0,2 cm** (T=0,2).  
So the equation for this example is:
